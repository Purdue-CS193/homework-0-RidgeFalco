# Ridge Falco's First CS193 Homework

My favorite things are...
- Video Games
- Music (Favorite genre is punk, but I also love pop, hyperpop, indie/alternative, ska, and post-punk!)
- Politics, History and Geography
- Problem Solving with Math and CS

Other than that, I'm just your average nerdy white guy I guess!
